This project is a short demonstration of AI pattern recognition and hierarchical clustering. 

The data used for this demo is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

This program works by reading data from a .csv file containing non-linearly seperable petal size and sepal size data from irises. Clustering is performed on the attributes, and the program will assign a colour to each datapoint denoting cluster membership. 

The results of the clustering are depicted in Figure 1. The shape of the datapoints describe the actual classification of the data, and the colour of each datapoint shows how this algorithm has classified them.
